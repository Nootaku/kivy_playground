# Kivi testrun

The aim of this repository is to learn how to make a cross-platform application using [Kivi](https://kivy.org/).<br/>To do so, we set ourselves 3 sub-objectives:

1. Follow the video by **FreeCodeCamp** - [Kivy Course - Create Python Games and Mobile Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8Imtec4ReQ)
2. Create the projects of the video (_Lab_ and _Galaxy_)
3. Build a custom project: **_Wheel Wizard_** that offers a collection of videos to learn Wizard Skating. (more info below)

### Description

Application that offers a collection of video tutorials to learn Wizard Skating. The idea is to offer the possibility to the user to either stream the videos or to download them locally on their phone for access offline.

As storage space might be a problem, only 10 videos can be downloaded simultaneously.
