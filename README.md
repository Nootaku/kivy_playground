# Kivy testrun

The aim of this repository is to learn how to make a cross-platform application using [Kivy](https://kivy.org/).<br/>To do so, we set ourselves 3 sub-objectives:

1. Follow the video by **FreeCodeCamp** - [Kivy Course - Create Python Games and Mobile Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8Imtec4ReQ)
2. Create the projects of the video (_Lab_ and _Galaxy_)
3. Build a custom project: **_Wheel Wizard_** that offers a collection of videos to learn Wizard Skating. (more info below)

### Lab

This is our first introduction to Kivy library. We create a simple project with a simple structure.<br/>
The main objectives of this project is to get a good grasp of **Layouts**, **Widgets** and **Canvases**.

The **Navigation** - allowing multiple screens - is not covered in the free course but the API documentation of the class can be found in the documentation under the name [Screen Manager](https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.uix.screenmanager.html)

### Galaxy

## Wheel Wizard

### Description

Application that offers a collection of video tutorials to learn Wizard Skating. The idea is to offer the possibility to the user to either stream the videos or to download them locally on their phone for access offline.

As storage space might be a problem, only 10 videos can be downloaded simultaneously.
